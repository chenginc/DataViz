It is necessary to store this parameters in a Database system and show the current sensor value in the UI.As S-7 1200 plc has web server built in it.I took the advantage of it. Socket programming is used to connect with the plc. Then web scraping technique is for data scraping. It has also a database to store the sensor data.
